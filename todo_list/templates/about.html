        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a team of student developers from DePaul University who built this ToDo web app as part of a CSC-394 / IS 376 software engineering project.
  Our goal was to create a simple and functional productivity tool using Django, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL, wrapped in a clean and responsive UI.</p>
